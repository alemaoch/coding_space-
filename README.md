# coding_space-
This is a coding environment for my past, present and future projects. The topics range from Full stack development to machine learning and data mining applications. Feel free to send me a message on future improvements/collaborations. 
My most recent endevour is with the Construction industry. I believe that there is a big shift happening within this space, especially with the topic of Automation.
There is a methodology called "TAKT", which essentially breaks down constructions/housing development into Vertical and Horizontal development. I.e. the vertical development (Up and Down) would require the Plumbing, HVAC and piping teams to move in first than the Horizontal Development (Left to Right) would be the dry wallers, framers, etc.
I believe that there needs to be a proper management scheduling system in place to coordinate these teams to create a more efficient work flow. This is only done when the right software is built for the right companies to use.
I am working on a management service software system to handle just this.
